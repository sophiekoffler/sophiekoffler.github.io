          <span id="aboutI">Hello, I'm Sophie Koffler, a web developer seeking a front-end development position. Recently graduated from UMASS with a Master's in Computer Science, I have the skills to implement the full stack. Complementing my technicals skills and educational background are the sense of style and highly creative edge I've honed over the years engaged in artistic pursuits. Please check out my portfolio which includes a website for my jewelry business as well as a collection of works from various art mediums I've explored. Clicking on the title of a project will link you to a live version; the code can be found on my github account. <br />
          <br />
          Please enjoy. I look forward to hearing from you.

              <p id="p1Desc" class="description">This project allowed me to explore the process of designing a website in its entirety. This site's purpose is to serve as a portfolio for SLK Designs, my handcrafted artisan jewelry business. The site is fully responsive and dynamic. The content displayed on the necklace and earrings pages reflect current inventory. The site is scripted in php and utilizes javascript, AJAX and mysql. The implementation used to populate the necklace and earring pages differ, as the data for each subset was stored in a different manner on the server. This provided me the opportunity to handle both cases. Necklace data is pulled from a database by a php script that is executed through an AJAX call. Earring data is simply read from a JSON file stored on the server.</p>
