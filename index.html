          <p>Hello, I'm Sophie Koffler and I'm a web developer. I recently graduated from UMASS with a Master's in Computer Science, so while I'm seeking a front-end web development job I actually have the skills to do the full stack. Having doubled as an artist, I also bring a sense of style and a highly creative edge to the table which complement my technical skills and educational background.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Please check out my portfolio which includes a website for my jewelry business and a portfolio of various art mediums I've explored. </p>

          <p id="p1Desc" class="description">This project allowed me to explore the process of designing and creating a website from start to finish. The site is a portfolio site for SLK Designs, my handcrafted artisan jewelry business. The site is responsive and dynamic. The content displayed on the necklace and earrings pages reflects current inventory. The site is scripted in php and utilizes javascript, AJAX and mysql. The implementation for the necklace and earrings pages differ. The necklace information is pulled from the database through an AJAX call while the earrings information is read from a JSON file stored on the server.</p>

          <p id="p2Desc" class="description">Colmar Academy is the capstone project from Codeacademy's Pro Intensive Build Websites from Scratch. The site is a landing page for a fictitious university and illustrates skills learned in the course, including ability to deliver product according to spec. In this case the layout was provided in the spec and typography and color scheme was left up to the student. The layout was constructed using css flexbox. </p>

          <p id="p3Desc" class="description">Colorful Artistry is a project that was designed to explore the css grid layout and play around with its ability to make responsive sites as well as its ability to allow for different layouts than were possible to create using grid. The content of the site showcases some of the artwork I've done, categorized by medium. </p>

This can be seen by opening the project in a desktop browser and veiwing the way the design adapts as you change the width of the browser. This is all done through grid, no media queries needed.  </p>
